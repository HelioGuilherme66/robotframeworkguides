# Writing Your First Code
Robot Framework is a versatile and powerful test automation framework that uses plain text syntax. It is designed to be easy to read and write, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of Robot Framework syntax to get you started.

## File name
You can name your files anything you like, as long as they have the .robot extension. For example: 'MyFirstTest.robot'.

## Sections
A Robot Framework test suite consists of multiple test cases organized within a single file. The basic structure of a test suite file includes the following sections:

1. Settings
1. Test Cases/Tasks
{/* Ìf more content is added, the titles above should get deeplinks */}
Although there are additional sections available, the Test Cases/Tasks section is mandatory for running a test.
### Settings
The Settings section is where you define the libraries, resource files, and other settings needed for your test suite.
```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library    String
```

The libraries contain the keywords (functions/steps) that Robot Framework uses to execute tests. Each library includes documentation of the keywords it provides. To use these, importing the library is necessary.

### Test Cases/Tasks
The Test Cases or Tasks section is where you define your individual test cases/tasks. Each test case/task is a sequence of keywords. These keywords determine the steps or actions that your test or task performs. There is no limit to the number of steps a testcase can have, but there are good practices and it is good to create conventions with your co-workers to ensure readability.
```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Create A Random String
    Log To Console    We are going to generate a random string
    Generate Random String  10
    Log To Console    We finished generating a random string
```

## Indentation
You can see in the provided examples that Robot Framework code is separated by spaces. To be able to correctly differentiate Robot Framework needs **at least 2 spaces**. A few examples that you can see in the code we have seen until now:
```robotframework
Library    String
```
- `Library` in the Settings section is unindented. This indicates that `Library` is the setting we are declaring.
- Between `Library` and `String` are several spaces. This indicates that `String` is a library that we need for our tests.

```robotframework
Create A Random String
    Log To Console    We are going to generate a random string
    Generate Random String  10
    Log To Console    We finished generating a random string
```
- `Create A Random String` in the Test Cases section is unindented. This indicates that it is a testcase name
- The lines below `Create A Random String` are indented. Indicating that these are keywords that we use in our testcase
- Between `Generate Random String` and `10` are several spaces. This indicates that 10 is an argument for our keyword, meaning our random string will be 10 characters long.
- Our `Log To Console` keywords are followed by a few spaces and a sentence. The spaces ensure that the following sentence is the text that we want to log to our console.

So you can see that spacing and indentation is extremely important in Robot Framework. It is neccesary to show the difference between a keyword and arguments that we use in our keywords. And also to differentiate between our test names and the keywords of our test.
Remember, to be able to correctly differentiate Robot Framework needs at least 2 spaces. More is also allowed. In the [Style Guide](../style_guide.md#horizontal-spacing) you can find more about conventions regarding spacing.
