# Writing Your First Test
Robot Framework is a versatile and powerful test automation framework that uses plain text syntax. It is designed to be easy to read and write, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of Robot Framework syntax to get you started.

## File name
You can name your files anything you like, as long as they have the .robot extension. For example: 'MyFirstTest.robot'.

## Sections
A Robot Framework test suite consists of multiple test cases organized within a single file. The basic structure of a test suite file includes the following sections:

1. Settings
1. Test Cases/Tasks
{/* Ìf more content is added, the titles above should get deeplinks */}
Although there are additional sections available, the Test Cases/Tasks section is mandatory for running a test.
### Settings
The Settings section is where you define the libraries, resource files, and other settings needed for your test suite.
```robotframework
*** Settings ***
Library    SeleniumLibrary
```

The libraries contain the keywords (functions) that Robot Framework uses to execute tests. Each library includes documentation of the keywords it provides. To use these, importing the library is necessary.

### Test Cases/Tasks
The Test Cases or Tasks section is where you define your individual test cases/tasks. Each test case/task is a sequence of keywords (actions).

```robotframework
*** Test Cases ***
Open Browser And Go To Homepage
    [Documentation]    This test case opens the browser and navigates to the homepage of Robot Framework.
    Open Browser    chrome
    Go To    https://www.robotframework.org
    Title Should Be    Robot Framework
```
