[Allure Report](https://allurereport.org/) is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what have been tested in a neat web report form, but allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests.

It is integrated with Robot Framework via a listener [robotframework-allure](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-python). A detailed integration guide is available on the official website: https://allurereport.org/docs/robotframework/
